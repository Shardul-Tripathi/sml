\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Today it is hard for developers to create secure implementations using cryptographic techniques.
Typical developers lack an understanding of cryptography protocols
and cannot be expected to implement them correctly without tool support.
In an ideal world, a developer declares the functionality to be implemented
in a general purpose programming language and an automatic tool takes care
of all the cryptography and generates a secure and efficient implementation  of the functionality. 
This paper provides a language-based solution to make
secure multiparty computation (SMC) accessible to the software developer community. \nc{Why do we call it SMC? A bit non-standard for crypto audiences isnt it?}

%Most cryptographic tools rely on circuit as abstractions for any general computation but real-life developers write programs. It is critical to address this fundamental  representation gap to make cryptography accessible to non-crypto specialist developers. In this work, we address this gap for the case of secure multi-party computation.

%Most cryptographic tools are very hard to use non-crypto specialist developers. The task becomes even more tedious and error-prone for the case of secure multiparty computation since different protocol implementations require the function to be expressed in different representations such as Boolean or Arithmetic circuits. To make cryptography accessible to non-crypto specialist developers, we need to design systems that do crypto automatically and satisfy the properties of ... 

Secure multi-party computation \cite{yao,gmw} (SMC) is a powerful cryptographic tool that allows a set of mutually distrusting parties to compute a joint function of their secret inputs. Examples of these include various machine learning prediction algorithm where one party holds the secret input such as a medical report and the other party holds the ML model for disease prediction. Since the introduction of SMC in 1980's, there has been a large body of work \cite{..} that has transformed SMC from a mere theoretical tool to something practically efficient and usable. Hence, there have been efforts to make SMC accessible to non-specialist programmers. To understand the state-of-the-art, let us consider the following toy example.

Suppose a developer wants to compute $w^Tx >0$ securely using SMC. With the current techniques, he has two options. \nc{The two options appear quite far apart in the text. Can we make bullet points maybe?} He can code up the functionality in a programmer friendly domain-specific language such as \cite{lambdaps,wysteria,oblivm} that would automatically compile it to an SMC protocol. The downside is that all of these works build on a cryptographic back-end that is either entirely boolean \cite{yao,gmw} or entirely arithmetic \cite{homo}. The efficiency of the generated SMC protocol is hence, bounded by the possibility of efficiently representing the function in a form that is compatible with the cryptographic back-end used. For instance, over $\ell$-bit integers, multiplication requires a boolean circuit of size  $O(\ell^2)$. 
For better efficiency, we would like to evaluate $w^Tx$ using an Arithmetic circuit and the comparison using a boolean circuit.
In fact, most interesting functions require a mix of arithmetic and boolean computations.
To address this issue, recently Demmler et al. \cite{aby} gave a cryptographic protocol for SMC where the parties can mix arithmetic and boolean computations. \footnote{Need to note somewhere that many works combined HE and Yao. Look at ABY for references.}
Hence, the second option is to write the functionality in the system developed in \cite{aby}.
However, using their system requires the programmer to be aware of complex trade-offs between arithmetic and boolean cryptographic schemes. In their framework, the programmer is required to write circuits consisting of  arithmetic and boolean gates along with appropriate conversion gates. In short, as is also mentioned by the authors themselves, the current system is not suitable to be used by non-specialist programmers. \nc{Also say that the programmer would need to know which functionality is better suited for arithmetic/boolean and also how to split the complete functionality into such parts.} \divya{Change tone...}
Our work .....
\nc{Should we also say here that a third option is to hire a cryptographer and build specific crypto protocols for the functionalities? :) This seems to be the option we are targetting when we show our comparisons and we say that we beat or match hand-crafted protocols}


%Unfortunately, implementing functionalities using SMC protocols requires thorough understanding of cryptography. To allow for widespread use of SMC, it is critical that SMC protocols are programmable by non-cryptographic experts. To cater to this, there have been several efforts developing domain-specific languages that are programmer friendly and compile to a SMC protocol. Most notable of these domain specific languages and systems include \cite{...}. All of these works build on a cryptographic back-end that is either entirely boolean \cite{yao,gmw} or arithmetic \cite{homo}. In fact, most of these works use boolean circuits based scheme for completeness\footnote{Note that comparisons cannot be expressed in arithmetic circuits}. However, most interesting functions require a mix of arithmetic and boolean computations.  Examples include ......... As one can expect, compiling these programs to boolean circuits is one of the biggest efficiency bottlenecks. \divya{Our work addresses this performance bottleneck.}

%To address this issue \divya{on the cryptographic side}, recently Demmler et al. \cite{aby} gave a cryptographic protocol for SMC where the parties can mix arithmetic and boolean computations and claimed potentially great performance benefits. However, using their system requires the programmer to be aware of trade-offs of arithmetic and boolean cryptographic schemes. In their framework, the programmer is required to write circuits consisting of a mix of arithmetic and boolean gates along with appropriate conversion gates. In short, as is also mentioned by the authors themselves, the current system is not suitable to be used by non-specialist programmers.


%%%%%%%Recent works \cite{aby,secureml,minion} have shown that great performance benefit can be obtained by mixing arithmetic and boolean computations in the back-end. Certain computations such as integer multiplication are efficient when implemented using arithmetic SMC \cite{gmw} whereas max(x,0) needs to be computed using a boolean back-end \cite{yao}. More details later.. ABY \cite{aby} requires programmer to be aware of arithmetic and boolean trade-offs and  write high-level circuits consisting of both arithmetic and boolean gates and share-conversion gates. Other works such as \cite{secureml,minion} build on ideas from \cite{aby} and develop tailor made algorithms for neural network training and prediction \cite{ml} and claim huge improvements over only boolean implementations. As is already mentioned in these works, their systems are mere proofs-of-concept and far from being implementable.

In this work, we develop and implement our framework \tool \nc{I still like EasyPC :)} for secure computation that achieves generality, performance and programmer productivity. The programmer writes a high level C-like program (instead of a circuit) to describe the function to be computed. Our compiler automatically generates an SMC protocol using a mix of Arithmetic and Boolean compute. Our compiler is general and can work with any secure implementation of a mix of arithmetic and boolean computations. In our work, we focus on semi-honest secure two-party computation. We build on ABY \cite{aby} that provides the suitable cryptographic back-end in this setting. We provide a formal type system and prove correctness and security of our compiler. We evaluate our system on various benchmarks such as logistic regression and convolutional neural network (CNN) for MNIST data \cite{minionn}, naive bayes, decision trees from \cite{shafindss}. Evaluations show that protocols generated by our compiler match the performance of hand-crafted protocols in most cases (see \sectionref{sec:eval}). \divya{Below, we will  give an overview of \tool and describe our contributions in more detail.}

%The programmer is oblivious of the cryptographic back-end being used. Our compiler automatically compiles it to a circuit framework consisting to both arithmetic and boolean gates as well share-conversion gates wherever required. We use ABY as the cryptographic backend. \divya{Say something about what kind of backend we want. provides SMC for a mix of arithmetic and boolean circuit with appropriate secure conversion between two types and ABY provides such a framework for semi-honest 2pc.} Our work is compatible with malicious, multiparty as well... etc We give a type system, correctness ..... We evaluate our framework on ... and show performance comparable and even better than tailor made protocols. It is simple to program in our framework and our work provides a meaningful baseline for future works designing tailor made protocols for specific functionalities.

\subsection{\tool: Overview and Contributions} 
\label{sec:contrib}
%Write high level overview of programming language and tool.. \divya{have some preamble}

\tool is a programmer-friendly framework to express the function to be computed and uses a mix of arithmetic and boolean SMC back-ends. We illustrate the above toy example of $w^Tx >0$ in our language in \figureref{ex-sml}. As is clear from the code, the programmer is not required to write keywords such as {\em secret} or {\em public} and can remain completely oblivious of the cryptographic back-end. In contrast, \figureref{ex-aby} illustrates the same example using the framework in ABY \cite{aby}. Here, as already mentioned, the programmer needs to write the low level gates like $\mathrm{MULT, ADD, CONS, GT}$, etc. The programmer is also required to use the appropriate share conversion gates such as A2Y that converts Arithmetic shares to Yao shares. 

Our compiler is aware of cryptographic costs of different representations and inter-conversions.  Based on these costs, our compiler, given a program in \tool, automatically picks Arithmetic and Boolean representations for different sub-parts of the program and inserts the required inter-conversions as well. 
Our experiments show that automatically generated protocols using \tool match the performance of tailor-made protocols in \cite{minionn,shafindss} (see \sectionref{eval}). This shows that  \tool achieves generality, performance and programmer productivity. These features allow us to evaluate our system on a variety of benchmarks, especially, state-of-the-art ML prediction algorithms with \emph{real} data and models. 

We give a formal {\em type system} for our language and prove useful properties. We prove that if a program type checks in our language then it would run correctly, e.g., there would not be any array index out of bounds error. The programmer writes a single code describing the inputs from each party and the function to be computed. Our compiler automatically generates separate executables for the server and the client that can be executed in the distributed setting. We prove the {\em correctness} for this compilation, i.e., the outputs obtained in the distributed execution are identical to the stand-alone execution by a trusted third party. We formally reduce the {\em security} of our system to the security of the cryptographic back-end. For details on formal language, correctness and security theorems see \sectionref{ld}.
\nc{Shall we have paragraph heads or someting to outline the different contributions? Above feels like one big story.}

Another issue in adoption of SMC is difficulty in scaling to large programs. 
%In general, SMC implementations struggle in scaling to large programssize of memory on a system limits the largest compute inside the SMC and hence,. 
The reason being all SMC implementations use a circuit-like representation as an intermediate representation. Hence, the largest compute that can be done securely is upper-bounded by the largest circuit that can fit in memory on a machine. \nc{Should we point out here that ABY itself has an explicit limit on circuit size and also give an example of a program that easily surpasses this bound? Also, hadnt ABY also said something about this? If so, we can mention this.}
To address this issue, we develop a technique called \emph{pipelining} that allows us to run aribitrarily large programs. At a high level, we break the original program into a sequence of small sub-programs and mask the intermediate outputs using secure secret sharing between the two parties. We appropriately append the share-reconstruction function to the beginning of the subsequent sub-program. Now, we execute each of these sub-programs sequentially in our framework. We provide details of pipelining and prove the correctness and security of this transformation in \sectionref{pipe}.

Finally, our framework \tool can serve as a meaningful baseline for future works on hand-crafted SMC protocols for specific functionalities such as \textsc{MiniONN} \cite{minionn}. 
Prior to our work, garbled circuit based two-party computation is cited as the most practical approach and used as the baseline for comparison of performance. But, it has been observed multiple times this approach does not even scale on realistic examples.
